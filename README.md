Chapter 1: Static optimization
Chapter 2: Discrete-time system control

This repository is to give you the example of the discrete-time system control from Lewis et al. (2012)

# 'main_ch1.m' and 'main_ch2.m' are the scripts for demonstating the math equations from the textbook.
# 'main_DP.m' is for dynamic programming of the feedback control strategy by a graident-based optimizer, sqp.
